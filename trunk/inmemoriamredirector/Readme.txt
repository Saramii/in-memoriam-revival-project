How it works:

This application simplifies installing and removing of redirection block for servers of In Memoriam
Revival Project. It downloads list of IP directions and name servers, and write them into "hosts" archive.
If application restarts DNS cache properly, reboot after installing will not be needed. If reboot is needed, 
application will invite you to reboot.

Install and uninstall can be made manually by editing the "hosts" file with a text editor. The location for the
"hosts" file depends of your operative system. Check this:

The updated list of redirections for In Memoriam Revival Project sites can be found at:

http://inmemoriam.softbreakers.com/iplist.txt

Second line of this file idenfities the version of the file. This block must be copy and paste at the end of the 
"hosts" file.

Be careful when you install redirections from non trusted sites. Someone could redirect your PC to cloned sites 
to stole access credentials. Because of that, and for your peace of mind, you can use the manually process 
described in order to access the In Memoriam Revival project sites.

Secondly, by checking the list of redirections you could discover information related to game that it should be 
discover while playing.
